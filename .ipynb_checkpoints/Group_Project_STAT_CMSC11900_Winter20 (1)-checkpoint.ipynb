    "\n",
    "### Deadlines: \n",
    "\n",
    "- project proposal: Thursday, February 27 at 11:00am\n",
    "- group presentation: Wednesday, March 11 at 4:00pm\n",
    "- final report and notebook: Thursday, March 12 at noon\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to go through the complete data science process to answer questions you have about some topic of your own choosing. You will acquire the data, design your visualizations, run statistical analysis, and communicate the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a group project where groups assignments are made by the instructors.  We recognize that individual schedules and other constraints might limit your ability to work in a team. If this the case, please come and discuss with us. In general, we do not anticipate that the grades for each group member will be different. However, we reserve the right to assign different grades to each group member based on peer assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Project proposal**: one paragraph discussing the project goals. This will not be used for the project score - it is a way to check what the instructors think about your ideas. Please indicate in the proposal the source of the data used for the project.\n",
    "- **Presentation**: Each group will present to the instructors, TAs and the rest of the class on March 11. The format of the presentation: **poster**. More details will be given in class in the next weeks.\n",
    "- **Report**: The report should reflect comments received during presentation. **The reports should be at most four pages long.**\n",
    "- **Notebook**: a high-quality and readable Python Jupyter notebook. You should strive for doing things the right way and think about aspects such as reusability etc. We also expect you to document your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Report Objectives###\n",
    "\n",
    "The report should cover these aspects:\n",

    "-    Initial Questions: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?\n",
    "-    Data: Source, scraping method, cleanup, etc.\n",
    "-    Exploratory Analysis: What visualizations did you use to look at your data in different ways? What are the different statistical methods you considered? Justify the decisions you made. How did you reach these conclusions?\n",
    "-    Final Analysis: What did you learn about the data? How did you answer the questions? How can you justify your answers?\n",
    "-     Group member contributions: Please state at the end the role each member of the team had in the project.\n",
